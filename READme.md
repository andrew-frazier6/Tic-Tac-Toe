## TIC-TAC-TOE 

* Take a look https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

## ABOUT

* The project was a choice of any way we wanted to build out the game. I chose a very simple color aligning version. I belive simplicity and great functionality are key to great user interaction. The game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## VISUAL

* My main focus was the game itself and not entirely the visual, though once I completed the game I thought about a place where I might enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Somewhere with fresh air, clear views and a relaxing atmosphere.
